# Breast Cancer Detector 🎀

## 🌟 Overview
The **Breast Cancer Detector** is an AI-powered tool that analyzes histopathological images to classify whether cancer is present or not. This project uses deep learning techniques to deliver highly accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool in early detection and treatment planning.

---

## 🎯 Features
- **Upload Image**: Users can upload histopathological images in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` format.  
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images with high accuracy.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays classification results along with the confidence percentage.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive experience.
